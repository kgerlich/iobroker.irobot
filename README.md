# ioBroker.irobot
=================

This adapter connects a iRobot Roomba to IoBroker.

It only supports very simple things like start, pause and docking the robot.

It will tell you if the robot is stuck and if it is in a cleaning cycle.

I will update this whenever I like but if you want some specific feature, please
file an issue.
